# ECE 425/525 Project

**Team P07 | Fall 2026**

An interactive learning and career advisor for prospective and current University of Arizona ECE students. The first prototype connects student interests with course evidence, complementary resources, and a configurable RAG pipeline.

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer is required. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate with `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` instead.

The app starts in **preview mode** without API keys. Choose a career direction, add completed courses with the searchable picker, and select **Update my roadmap**. The plan groups suggestions into **Start here**, **Build toward**, and **Later goals**. Restore/download JSON files under **Saved profile** to carry progress between sessions.

On Windows, the tested Python version is 3.12. You can skip activation:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run app.py
```

If Python 3.12 is missing, install it first with `winget install --exact --id Python.Python.3.12 --source winget`, then reopen PowerShell. To update an existing clone, stop the app with Ctrl+C, run `git pull`, and launch it again.

## Enable live RAG

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `GEMINI_API_KEY`. The example uses `gemini-embedding-2` and `gemini-3.8-flash`, subject to account availability. Model IDs are configurable through the environment. Server keys are never used as widget defaults.

For local development only, `ECE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=true` enables editable model IDs and an empty session-only key field when no server key exists. Keep this off for a shared deployment.

Precompute the index with:

```bash
python scripts/build_index.py
```

Enable **Generate AI explanations**, then update the roadmap. Retrieved evidence is passed to the generator. Recommendation IDs and citations are validated before rendering.

To compare real keyword, semantic, and hybrid RAG requests and save their answers/timings:

```bash
python scripts/verify_live.py
```

Add `--jobs` to also check the configured Adzuna connection. These opt-in checks use real provider quota. Inspect the saved answers against their sources before using them in the report.

Source exploration is retrieval-only. It does not count as a completed live RAG demonstration.

## Current features

- Dark dashboard and student profile.
- Three learning stages, a bridge course for each direction, and explanations of suggested learning connections.
- Five source-linked courses and two online resources.
- Keyword, semantic, and hybrid retrieval.
- Independent prerequisite evaluation with blocked courses kept as later goals.
- Structured Gemini generation and citation checks.
- Evidence inspector and ranking chart.
- PCA projection and cosine drill-down when embeddings are available.
- Versioned public-record embedding cache.
- Profile export/import, searchable coursework entry, and Mark completed actions.
- Direction comparison for students who are still exploring.
- Coverage clarification for clear requests outside the starter collection.
- On-demand Adzuna search adapter with a short session cache.

Job search requires `ADZUNA_APP_ID` and `ADZUNA_APP_KEY`. No listings are fabricated when the provider is unavailable.

## Academic data

The development target is automatic retrieval from official academic sources, with source links, retrieval dates, and a temporary cache. Saved PDFs, CSV exports, and screenshots are development references. A permanent course database is optional. The current prototype still uses the bundled collection described below. See [RAG source retrieval](docs/01_RAG_DESIGN.md#obtaining-source-material) for the planned flow.

The starter collection covers ECE101, ECE369A, ECE372A, ECE425, and CSC120 from the current 2026–2027 catalog. Summaries are paraphrased and linked to official entries.

The public course entries return internal enrollment requirement IDs. Four ECE rules remain **unknown**. One CSC120 condition is reviewed against the current Computer Science program requirements, with its source linked in the app. Recorded prerequisite satisfaction does not establish complete enrollment eligibility.

Failed grades cannot be entered as successful completions. Missing prerequisite grades remain unknown. Learning-stage annotations are team suggestions and do not place courses into semesters.

```bash
python scripts/refresh_sources.py
```

This stages source metadata and hashes without modifying approved records.

## Tests and evaluation

```bash
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/evaluate.py --runs 20
```

Tests cover backend behavior and Streamlit interactions. Controlled providers test RAG integration without model requests. Live model and job calls need separate credentialed checks.

The refinement includes regression tests for the review findings. See [prototype verification](docs/07_PROTOTYPE_VERIFICATION.md) and [refinement notes](docs/08_REFINEMENT_NOTES.md) for checks and remaining limits.

The evaluation script is a keyword-only smoke check, not a completed research benchmark.

## Project documents

Start with [the documentation index](docs/README.md) and [team progress](docs/06_TEAM_PROGRESS.md).

Automatic account-based persistence, broader academic-rule coverage, the six sample-paper reviews, and the held-out evaluation remain in the roadmap.
